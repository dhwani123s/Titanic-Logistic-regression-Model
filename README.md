Project Overview:

The project focuses on predicting the survival of passengers aboard the Titanic using a logistic regression model. The dataset used for this analysis includes information about the passengers such as age, gender, passenger class, and fare. The objective is to build a predictive model that identifies key factors influencing survival, which can provide valuable insights into the characteristics associated with higher chances of survival during the disaster.

Skills Developed:
  - Data Preprocessing: Loading the Titanic dataset, handling missing values through imputation and column removal, and encoding categorical variables into numerical format.
  - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conducting visual analysis using heatmaps, count plots, and histograms to understand the distribution and relationships between different features and survival outcomes.
  - Feature Engineering: Creating new features by combining and transforming existing ones, and preparing the dataset for model training.
  - Model Building: Splitting the data into training and testing sets, and training a logistic regression model to predict passenger survival.
  - Model Evaluation: Assessing the performance of the model using confusion matrix, accuracy score, and classification report to evaluate prediction accuracy and model effectiveness.


Technology Used:
  - Python Programming Language
  - Libraries and Tools:
    - NumPy: For numerical computations and handling arrays.
    - Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
    - Matplotlib and Seaborn: For creating visualizations and plots.
    - Scikit-learn: For implementing the logistic regression model and model evaluation metrics.
    - Google Colab: As the development environment for running and testing the code.

Use Case:

This project serves as an educational case study in predictive modeling, particularly in the context of logistic regression. By understanding the factors that influenced survival on the Titanic, one can draw parallels to risk assessment and decision-making in various fields such as transportation safety, disaster management, and health care. The insights gained can help improve strategies for mitigating risk and enhancing survival chances in critical situations. Additionally, the methodologies applied in this project are applicable to other classification problems where predicting binary outcomes is essential.
